## [0.9.8]

### Removed
- Crossblooded sorcerer prerequisites becouse it caused a conflict and made the entire class unplayable.

### Changed
- Wish spell loading so it generates ids untill it finds one that is not duplicate and duplicate  Ids are dumped in miracle preloading.

## [0.9.7]

### Added
- Arcane Bloodline now gets Metamagic Adept as part of its 3rd level power, and
  with Arcane Apotheosis (at level 20), metamagic won't increase casting time
  (this matches PnP bloodline).

### Changed
- Oracles now get 3+int skill points, similar to Druids (4+int is correct in
  PnP, but the game has condensed skills, so it should be 3 to match other
  classes). This fix can be disabled in settings, and is not retroactive for
  existing Oracle's skill ranks (unless they respec).

### Fixed
- Spells added by this mod can now be used in specialist Wizard slots.
- Eldritch Scions can now pick Extra Arcana or the new Magus arcanas.
- Magical Knack caster level bonus now shows up in the Spellbook UI text.
- Tongues curse now allows animal companions to be controlled if you can talk
  to the corresponding NPC.

  from being initialized.

  (for spontaneous casters).
- Delayed Blast Fireball can now be used with Selective Spell.


## [0.9.4]

### Fixed
- Update mod to work against game version 1.2.3 (other fixes planned for 0.9.4
  will be released as 0.9.5, to get this out ASAP).


## [0.9.3]

### Fixed
- Fix serious regression from the 0.9.2 attempted Respec mod fix; this allowed
  multiple trait selections via multiclassing.
- Life Link is now removed on rest, and no longer requires 2 resources per link.

## [0.9.2]

### Added
- New setting to disable the Tongues curse penalty, as it may catch players by
  surprise that they can't control some of their party (similar to PnP, the
  curse prevents communication with party members in combat, unless they speak
  your language. They can learn your language with 1 rank in Knowledge: World.)

### Fixed
- Possible fix for Respec mod issue with Traits/Favored class Bonus
  (note: Respec mod does not currently work on 1.2.0n, so unable to verify fix).
- Enable metamagic for many of the new spells that were missing it
  (Wall of Fire, Delayed Blast Fireball, Fly/Overland Flight, etc).
- Elemental Spell now works correctly with elemental damage immunities.
  (Previously it would sometimes check your immunity against the old element.)
- Fey Foundling now works with AOE healing effects (such as Channel Energy).
- Fly and Overland Flight buffs now correctly suppress their variants to prevent
  stacking multiple copies of the same buff.
- Carefully Hidden now gives the correct +1 will save instead of reflex.
- Life Link no longer plays visual/sound effects for fully healed targets.
- Clarify description of Meteor Swarm (implemented as +4 DC against the primary
  target if hit, rather than -4 to save).
- Tiefling racial spell-like abilities no longer show up in spell selections
  (such as Magical Lineage).
- Add try+catch guards to patches that were missing them; this should increase
  stability. Improve logging for patches that fail to apply (patch errors will
  now log in UnityModManager.log in release builds).
- Possible fix for CharBSelectorLayer_FillData_Patch exception on PF:K 1.1.6
  (the patch is used for Ancient Lorekeeper race prerequisite, and can be
  disabled in settings).

### Added
- Reckless (Combat Trait)

### Fixed
- Fix prerequisites for sorcerer bloodline bonus feats, for ones that are used by
  archetypes: Fey (Sylvan), Celestial (Empyreal), and Arcane (Sage). (These could

- Portrait Loader can now load from portrait directories with non-integer names.
- Some trait bonuses (such as Fate's Favored) now show up in the combat log.
